I am a birdwatcher, cyclist, cook and developer. That's about as concise as I can put it. Each note should be a little slice of something I enjoy doing or consumning, from cooking big dinners, heading to the park to go birdwatching or just riding my bike. I hope you enjoy this application as much as I enjoyed building it and I am looking forward to hearing from you!",
