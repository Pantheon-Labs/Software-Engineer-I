# `Anime Display`
This project is a humble project that I made because I am a huge anime fan.<br>
This project uses the AniApi to get its anime and display it in order of their rating.<br>
Users are able to search their favorite anime and search by genre.<br>
I made this using NextJS and Chakra.<br>

## `If I had more time`
If I had more time I would build out more pages.<br>
For example I would have a movies page, music page, etc.<br>
I woul also have made filters.<br> 
The biggest asdition I would make would be to give users a place where they could watch their chosen anime for free
